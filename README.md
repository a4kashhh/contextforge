# ContextForge AI

ContextForge AI is an engineering intelligence platform designed for full-stack microservices architectures and distributed software systems. Unlike conventional coding tools that evaluate isolated code files, ContextForge AI aggregates software requirements, microservices architecture, application controllers, database schemas, git history, issue trackers, automated test suites, and OpenTelemetry distributed traces into a unified Engineering Context Knowledge Graph.

## Overview

Modern software engineering involves complex interactions across distributed microservices. Diagnosing systemic issues such as connection leaks, latency spikes, and cascading failures often requires tracing relationships across multiple layers. ContextForge AI provides automated root-cause analysis, dependency impact analysis, and load test validation through an interactive interface.

## Key Features

### 1. Interactive Context Knowledge Graph
- Visualizes entity relationships across eight node types: Requirements, Services, API Endpoints, Database Queries, Commits, Issues, Load Tests, and OpenTelemetry Traces.
- Supports interactive node positioning, panning, zooming, filtering by node type, and inspection of metadata.

### 2. AI Incident and Root-Cause Reasoning Engine
- Performs an eleven-stage automated reasoning traversal (parsing APM logs, tracing connection pools, mapping diffs, verifying SLAs).
- Provides confidence scoring and APM evidence citations.
- Visualizes the causal call path from traffic spikes to downstream timeout error.

### 3. Microservice Impact and Dependency Propagation Analysis
- Analyzes upstream and downstream dependency ripple effects when modifying application logic or database queries.
- Computes risk metrics for regression probability, API SLA impact, and database load safety.

### 4. Automated Patch Generation and Code Diff Viewer
- Generates type-safe code diffs (such as connection pool recycling via try/finally blocks).
- Integrates a human review and approval workflow before deployment.

### 5. Automated Load Test and Performance Simulator
- Simulates high-throughput traffic load tests (10,000 RPS).
- Demonstrates real-time performance recovery from elevated error rates to full pass rates.

### 6. Requirements Traceability Matrix
- Maps functional and performance SLA requirements directly to API routes, controllers, tests, issues, and commits.

### 7. Executive Engineering Resolution Reports
- Generates structured summary reports containing root-cause analysis, evidence vectors, and validation results.
